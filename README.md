# PubSub excercise #

This is an excercise in which you will implement a simple PubSub interface using RTI NDDS.

The code defines a couple of interfaces and some tests using these interfaces.

Your mission is to make these tests pass without changing them (unless I made a mistake in making those tests).

You should probably start with reading the tests before you write any code.

You are encouraged to add tests of your own.
