Description
An RTI Connext QoS Profile that provides high throughput
for streaming reliable data.

This profile depends primarily on:

Data writer:
  - batch:    combining multiple samples into a single network packet to
              increase throughput
  - protocol: send heartbeats to readers more frequently to cache levels low

Data reader:
  - protocol: respond more aggressively to heartbeats with positive or
              negative acknowledgements to speed up repairs of lost packets

Domain participant:
  - Increased transport buffer sizes to efficiently send and receive many
    large packets

        The HighThroughput profile is an extension of the Reliable profile.
        RTI Connext provides APIs for loading multiple QoS
        profile files at once, and referring from one to the other, but for
        the sake of simplicity, we duplicate the Reliable profile here. For
        more information about how it works, see the file reliable.xml.
